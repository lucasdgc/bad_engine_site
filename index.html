  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Limitation as a decision</h2>
    <p>Bad Engine is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is not meant to be a full-fledged game engine, but rather a nice tool for learning and experimentation.</p>
    <p>For those who want to code their own 3D games, Bad Engine provides a framework to build upon. </p>
    <p>You can go straight to code your games instead of browsing convoluted documentation and watching outdated lessons.</p>

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>There are a few small games made with Bad Engine, all of them are pretty bad:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Game 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Game 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Game 3</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>
      <h3>Simple and compatible 3D rendering using OpenGL</h3>
      <p>OpenGL ensures compatibility with a wide range of hardware and platforms, specially older pcs. So no raytracing, no AI upscaling, no global ilumination. Just color textures and basic lighting.</p>
      <h3>Lightweight and fast</h3>
      <p>Bad Engine is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it ideal for low-end hardware. A compressed executable is around 1.5MB.</p>
      <h3>Cross-platform</h3>
      <p>Bad Engine can target Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It will be ported to Android and WebGL in the future.</p>
      <h3>Open Source</h3>
      <p>Bad Engine will soon be released as Open Source.</p>
